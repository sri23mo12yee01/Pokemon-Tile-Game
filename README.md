# Pokemon-Tile-Game
This is an attempt to make an interactive and user friendly game which helps improve the memory and recalling power of the users. It is an engaging game with cute pokemons on each tile. Each tile has another pair tile, and the user has to remember where which tile is. The tiles are faced upside down, ant the tile the user clicks on is turned to face up. If  it is the correct pair they stay face up side, but if it is incorrect they turn back down. The user has to match all tiles in the least number of moves possible, and in a stipulated time period. This will help keep the game engaging and make the user's memory and brain exercised and fresh.
